### Create a Custom Skill Using Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)


If you already created a custom skill at a different workshop, you can skip the creation step and go straight to activation.  Navigate to our [Alexa Skill Kit Quick Start Tutorial](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-quick-start-tutorial) and follow the instructions to build your own skill in 5 minutes!

Follow the onscreen steps to activate the skill on your device and test it.  Since your skills live in the cloud, once you've published your skill you can access it from any Alexa-enabled device!
