#### Unit Tests

1. For this workshop, tests have been pre-built to save time.  Go to the terminal window, and run the following steps to execute the series of Unit tests on your prototype.  If you have your earbuds or speakers in, you'll hear Alexa run through a series of audio tests as well as functional tests.

`
cd /home/pi/avs-sdk/build
make all test
