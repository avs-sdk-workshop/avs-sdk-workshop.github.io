### Register for an Amazon Developer Account

Unless you already have one, go ahead and create a free developer account at [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html). Click "sign in" at the upper right corner and create your account (or log in with your existing credentials).  You can review the **AVS Terms and Agreements** [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/support/terms-and-agreements).

Note - you can open these links in a new tab - and if you lose track of the lab manual, it's bookmarked in your chromium browser - just click on the "AVS workshop" tab!
