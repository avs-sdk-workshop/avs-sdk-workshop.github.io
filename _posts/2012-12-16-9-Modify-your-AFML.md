title: '9. Customize your Renderer'


layout: nil

Depending on the size of your screen or how your device is used, you might want to make changes in your screen's display behavior.  Navigate to the following folder in your File Manager: `/home/pi/Smart-screen-sdk-test/sdk_changes/GUI/js/src/components` and open it with a text editor.

Scroll down to where you see `Theme:COLORSCHEME.light` and change it to `Theme:COLORSCHEME.dark` - then ask for the weather again!  It should look different - better for low-light environments.

You can also try modifying the shape or screen size and see how the skills render differently.
