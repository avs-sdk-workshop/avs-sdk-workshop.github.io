### Register Your Product and Create a Security Profile

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through creating an Amazon developer account, registering your prototype or commercial device, and setting up your security profile. When finished, you'll have the credentials required to access the Alexa Voice Service (AVS).

### Create an Amazon developer account

Unless you already have one, go ahead and create a free developer account at [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html).

### Register your prototype and create a security profile

After you've created an Amazon developer account, you'll need to create a product and security profile. This will enable your software client to connect to AVS.

Log in to [developer.amazon.com](https://developer.amazon.com/login.html).  You should be in the Dashboard by default - click the **ALEXA VOICE SERVICE** button in the global navigation to start building products with Alexa built-in.

If this is your first time using AVS, you'll see a welcome screen. Click the **GET STARTED** button, then click the **CREATE PRODUCT** button.

If you're a returning developer, click the blue **CREATE PRODUCT** button at the top right corner of the screen.

### Fill in product information

1. *Product Name*: Use **AVS Tutorials Project**.
2. *Product ID*: Use **PrototypePi.** No spaces are allowed for the *Product ID* field.
3. Select **Device with Alexa built-in** for *Please Select Your Product Type*.
  Select **No** for *Will your device use a companion app?*
4. Choose **Other** for *Product Category* and write **Prototype** in the *(please specify)* and *Brief product description* field.
5. Select **Hands-free** for *How will users interact with your product?*
7. Skip the *Upload an image* step.  This is not required for prototyping.
8. Select **No** for *Do you intend to distribute this product commercially?*
9. Select **No** for *Will your device be used for Alexa for Business?*
9. Select **No** for *Is this a childrenâ€™s product or is it otherwise directed to children younger than 13 years old?*
10. Click **NEXT** to continue.

### Set up your security profile

1. Click **CREATE NEW PROFILE**.  

2. Enter your own custom **Security Profile Name** and **Security Profile Description** for the following fields - or use the below example names:   
	 - *Security Profile Name*: **AVS Tutorials Project**
	 - *Security Profile Description*: **AVS Tutorials**
	 - Click **NEXT**.  

	 **Security Profile ID** will be generated for you.

3. Select **Other devices and platforms** from the *Web - Android/Kindle - iOS - Other devices and platforms* options in the **Platform Information** section.

   - Write a name for your Client ID here - you can just use **Prototype**.
   - Click "Generate ID".  You should get a Client ID and an option to download it.
   - If you're creating this product profile on your Raspberry Pi, click **Download** to get your credentials onto your AVS prototype.  Save the config.json file to your `/home/pi` directory.  If you are creating this profile from a different PC, that's OK - you can leave the file to be downloaded later.
   - Check the box beside *I agree to the AVS agreement and the AVS Program Requirements.*
	 - Click **FINISH**.


Congratulations!  You now have access to the Alexa Voice Service APIs.  Click OK on the prompt to continue.  Your device should now be listed on your [AVS dashboard](https://developer.amazon.com/avs/home.html#/avs/homes).
