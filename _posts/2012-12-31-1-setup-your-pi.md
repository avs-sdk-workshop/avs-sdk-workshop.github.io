### Booting Your Pi

1. Plug in the power supply to the micro USB connector on the Pi.  You should see a loading screen go through some startup steps before booting to desktop - if you run into any errors, request a new SD micro card to boot the OS from.
2. Connect to wifi by clicking on the connectivity icon in the top right of the tool bar (next to the speaker icon).
3. Open a web browser by clicking on the globe icon in the top left toolbar.
