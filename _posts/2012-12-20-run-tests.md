This assumes the build is in the directory created by the script (avs-sdk).

#### Unit Tests

1. Go to the terminal window, and run the following steps.

`
UNIT_TEST_MODEL_PATH="$HOME/avs-sdk/avs-device-sdk/KWD/inputs/SensoryModels"
TEST_MODEL_DOWNLOAD="https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi/blob/master/models/spot-alexa-rpi-31000.snsr"
mkdir -p "UNIT_TEST_MODEL_PATH"
wget -O "$UNIT_TEST_MODEL_PATH/spot-alexa-rpi-31000.snsr" "$TEST_MODEL_DOWNLOAD"
cd "$HOME/avs-sdk/build"
make all test -j3
`

{:.steps}
#### Integration Tests (optional)

Integration tests will take some time to build and run. If the presentation hasn't re-started, then you can move onto this step. Otherwise you can return later and try it out!

1. From the build directory, run
`TZ=UTC make all integration`
