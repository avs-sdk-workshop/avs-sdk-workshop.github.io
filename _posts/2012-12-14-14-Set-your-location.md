### Choose your device's location on Alexa.Amazon.com

If you ask Alexa what's the weather, how does the AVS know where you are located?  If you wish to change your location to deliver your local weather, time zone, or other location-specific data, you can access your settings menu by navigating to [Alexa.amazon.com](https://Alexa.amazon.com/).

Navigate down to the **Settings** tab and select the device you created - you can identify it by your unique **Product Name** - if your sample app is up and running, you should see status as "Online".

Select your device, and change the location by Zip Code to whatever you prefer.  If you're not sure of your current local zip code - no need to look it up online, just ask Alexa what the zip code for Las Vegas is! ;-)

You won't need to restart your Sample App to see the change - as soon as you update your setting in the cloud, you'll receive data for that location.  Try asking Alexa what the weather is again and see where your device is now "located"!
